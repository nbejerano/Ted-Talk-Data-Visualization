# The Ideas that TED Spreads

### By Jamie Ullman, Kate Eselius, and Naama Bejerano

## Project Overview
TED's mission is to share ideas worth spreading, aiming to change attitudes, lives, and ultimately the world. We set out to answer the question: **What ideas is TED spreading?**

Our analysis focuses on TED talks published before 2017, using tags assigned to each talk as indicators of the themes TED promotes. These tags reveal the interactions between various topics and help us understand the broader themes present in TED's content.

### Visualization Details
We created an interactive sunburst visualization that:
- Groups TED tags into 10 thematic categories based on co-occurrence.
- Shows tag sizes proportional to the number of talks associated with each tag.
- Highlights tag co-occurrences through color-coded relationships.

### Key Insights
- **Technology, Entertainment, and Design:** While TED's core themes include these, our analysis suggests that technology dominates, followed by design, with entertainment playing a lesser role.
- **Interdisciplinary Nature:** Tags like "fish" show surprising connections across categories such as society, innovation, and biology.
- **Potential Redefinition:** Based on the most frequent tags, "Technology, Science, and Global Issues" might better describe the themes TED emphasizes.
